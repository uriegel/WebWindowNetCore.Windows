# WebWindowNetCore.Windows

This project is obsolete and development is stopped.

Alternative:

Use project [WebWindowNetCore](https://github.com/uriegel/WebWindowNetCore), Nuget package [WebWindowNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WebWindowNetCore/)

```WebWindowNetCore``` is the successor. You only have to use this package for Windows and Linux
